# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Users can deploy a crew of AI bots, watch them work in real-time, and see exactly what each bot cost and how well it performed — so they can trust and improve every run.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Data Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-18 — Plan 01-01 complete: pnpm monorepo + Drizzle schema for 6 tables, migration applied

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 4%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 7 min
- Total execution time: 7 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Bot hosting — dockerode on GCE VM recommended over Cloud Run Jobs for MVP (faster lifecycle control, tighter per-bot management). Cloud Run Jobs is the long-term target but has latency trade-offs. NEEDS prototype validation in Phase 2.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Task queue — BullMQ 5 on Redis recommended over Postgres row-level locking. If Redis is not yet available, Postgres locking is a valid fallback to reconcile in Phase 2.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Single-tenant MVP, no auth complexity. No Stripe. Billing is metering and display only.
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: moduleResolution: Bundler in packages/db tsconfig to fix drizzle-kit esbuild-register .js import incompatibility
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Integer cents for all monetary values (budgetCapCents, amountCents) - never float
- [Phase 01-data-foundation]: Extensionless imports in schema files for drizzle-kit esbuild-register CJS compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2 watch]: GCP bot hosting topology (Cloud Run Jobs vs GCE/dockerode) is the single most consequential unresolved architectural fork. Recommend a prototype to validate Cloud Run Jobs API latency under concurrent bot spawning before Phase 2 commits to either path.
- [Phase 3 watch]: Tool Gateway auth patterns and bot JWT rotation strategy are MEDIUM confidence. May need targeted research during Phase 3 planning.
- [Phase 5 watch]: Composite score weighting (40/30/20/10) is a reasoned starting point, not empirically validated. Plan to iterate after first real execution data is collected.
